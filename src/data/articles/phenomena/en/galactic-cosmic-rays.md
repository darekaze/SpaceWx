# Galactic Cosmic Rays

Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR) are the slowly varying, highly energetic background source of energetic particles consisting of a wide spectrum of elements that constantly bombard Earth. GCR originate outside the solar system and are likely formed by explosive events such as **supernova**.

The energetic particles are ionized and thus they interact and are influenced by the sun’s magnetic fields. Near the solar maximum (see "Phenomenon : Sunspots/Solar Cycle"), the solar wind modulates the fraction of the lower-energy GCR particles such that a majority cannot penetrate to Earth. On the other hand, GCR particles have easier access to Earth near solar minimum due to the absence of many coronal mass ejections (see "Phenomenon : Coronal Mass Ejections") and their corresponding magnetic fields.

These energetic charged particles are traveling near the speed of light. When they hit the atmosphere, large showers of secondary particles are created with some even reaching the ground. Nevertheless, these particles pose little threat to humans and systems on the ground. 

The Earth’s magnetic field works to deflect these particles away from the equatorial regions, but it provides little protection above roughly 55 degrees magnetic latitude. This constant shower of GCR particles at high latitudes can result in increased radiation exposures for aircrew and passengers at high latitudes and altitudes.
