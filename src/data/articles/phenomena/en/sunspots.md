# Sunspots/Solar Cycle

## Sunspots

Sunspots are areas on the **photosphere** (the visible surface of the Sun) which appear **darker** than the surrounding surface of the Sun due to their relatively **lower temperature** (from a background value of near 6000°C down to about 4200°C). The formation of sunspots is associated with solar magnetic disturbances. Sunspots can last from hours to months, which are carried around the solar surface by the Sun's rotation. They often appear in pairs or clusters. A moderate-sized sunspot is many times larger than the size of the Earth.

Sunspots often appear near 30-35 degrees North and South of the Sun's hemisphere at the beginning of the solar (or sunspot) cycle. They tend to appear in lower latitudes later, and can appear near 5 degrees North and South of the Sun's hemisphere near the end of the solar cycle.

## Solar (Sunspot) Cycle

The number of sunspots changes periodically. In the early stage of a solar cycle, the number of sunspots **increases** when the solar state changes from less active to more active. The period or year with the most sunspots is called **"solar maximum"**. It is also the time when the solar activity is most active and solar magnetic storms often occur. In the later stage of the solar cycle, the solar state becomes less active and the number of sunspots **decreases**. The period with the least sunspots is called **"solar minimum"**, during which the solar activity is most quiescent.

The period of a solar cycle usually refers to the duration starting at its solar minimum and ending at the next solar minimum. The whole period usually lasts for about **11 years**.  Solar cycles have been assigned consecutive numbers. This number assignment began with “solar cycle 1” in 1755 and the most recent being “cycle 24” – which began in December, 2008  (in 2019 it is nearing solar minimum). A new solar cycle is considered to have begun when sunspot groups reemerge at higher latitudes with the magnetic polarities of the leading spots opposite that of the previous cycle.

The official daily and monthly sunspot numbers are determined by the World Data Center – Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations ([WDC-SILSO](http://sidc.oma.be/silso/)) at the Royal Observatory of Belgium.
