The Ionosphere is part of the Earth’s upper atmosphere, located between 80 km and about 600 km altitude, where Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) and x-ray solar radiation ionizes the atoms and molecules, thus creating a layer of electrons.  Due to spectral variability of the solar radiation and the density of various constituents in the atmosphere, there are different layers created within the ionosphere, called the **D**, **E**, and **F-layers**.  These layers' altitude varies from season to season.

The ionosphere is important because it reflects and modifies radio waves used for communication and navigation. When high-energy particles from the Sun arrive the ionosphere, auroras would be generated (see [“Phenomenon : Aurora”](#/en/section/phenomena/aurora)).

## Ionospheric scintillation

Ionospheric scintillation is the rapid modification of radio waves caused by small scale structures in the ionospheric electron density along the signal path and is the result of interference of refracted and/or scattered waves. Severe scintillation conditions can prevent a GPS receiver from locking on to the signal and can make it impossible to calculate a position, while less severe scintillation conditions can reduce the accuracy and the confidence of positioning results. Scintillation is more prevalent at low and high latitudes. Mid-latitudes regions experience scintillation much less frequently.
