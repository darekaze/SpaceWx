Ionosphere is a combination of electrically charged atoms and molecules, locating at the altitude of 50-1000km. Ionosphere is separated into three main layers. They are called D layer, E layer and F layer. These layers' altitude varies from season to season. 

When the Sun's high-energy X-rays and ultraviolet light arrive the Earth's atmosphere, they would collide with gas molecules and atoms. This collision may knock some electrons free from the molecules and atoms, hence created electrically charged ions and free electrons. Ionosphere refers to the regions with higher concentrations of ions and free electrons.

When high-energy particles from the Sun arrive the ionosphere, auroras would be generated. (See phenomenon - aurora)
