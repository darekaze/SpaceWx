The F10.7 radio emissions refer to the **solar radio flux** at a wavelength of 10.7 cm (2800 MHz). These emissions originates high in chromosphere and low in the corona of the Sun. The F10.7 index is an excellent indicator of solar activity.

Many **Ultra-Violet** emissions that affect the stratosphere and ozone, and the Extreme UltraViolet (EUV) emissions that impact the ionosphere and modify the upper atmosphere, track well with the F10.7 index.  Therefore, the index has proven very valuable in specifying and forecasting space weather.  As it has been measured consistently in Canada since 1947, the index also provides climatology of solar activity due to its long record.
