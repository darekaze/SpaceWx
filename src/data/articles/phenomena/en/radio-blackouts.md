Solar flares occasionally erupt from the Sun's surface. A solar flare is a **violent solar activity** that is related to **a sudden burst of electromagnetic waves** and a **large release of charged particles** (mostly electrons) from the Sun.

Solar activities have been closely monitored since the development of advanced solar instruments. Scientists found that solar flares normally erupt near sunspots where comparatively stronger magnetic field is located. They generally agree that the energy released in a flare has been stored in the  Suns magnetic fields. Lines of magnetic field extend from the surface into the corona displaying arching shapes in broad loops. These loops trap extremely hot gas, where the temperature reaches 10 to 40 million degrees causing confined gas to emit **extreme ultraviolet radiation and x-rays**.

These X-ray and Extreme Ultra Violet radiation cause Radio Blackouts. They **ionize** the sunlit side of Earth, leading to large amount of energy lost as radio waves pass through this region, producing signal scintillations (which mean noise, distortion and attenuation) and **disrupting radio communication**.
