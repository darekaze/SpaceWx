Radio Blackouts are caused by bursts of **X-ray** and **Extreme Ultra Violet (EUV)** radiation emitted from **solar flares** (see <a href="#/en/section/phenomena/solar-flare">"Phenomenon : Solar Flares"</a>). Radio blackouts primarily affect High Frequency (HF) (3-30 MHz) communication, although fading and diminished reception may spill over to Very High Frequency (VHF) (30-300 MHz) and even higher frequencies. These storms are a consequence of enhanced electron densities caused by solar flare emissions. The emissions ionize the sunlit side of the Earth, which increases the amount of energy loss as radio waves pass through this region, producing **signal scintillations** (see <a href="#/en/section/phenomena/ionosphere">"Phenomenon : Ionosphere - Ionospheric scintillation"</a>) and thereby disrupting radio communication (see ["Impacts"](#/en/impacts)).

Radio blackouts are among the most common space weather events, and are the fastest to impact Earth. Minor events occur, on average, 2000 times each solar cycle. They usually last for several minutes, but some can last for hours.
