A geomagnetic storm is a major disturbance of the Earth's magnetosphere (see ["Phenomenon : Magnetosphere"](/#/en/section/phenomena/earth-magnetosphere)) that occurs when there is a very efficient exchange of energy from solar wind into the space environment surrounding the Earth. These storms result from variations in the solar wind that produces major changes in the currents, plasmas, and fields in the Earth’s magnetosphere.  The conditions for effective transfer of energy include sustained periods of high-speed solar wind, and most importantly, a southward directed solar wind magnetic field (opposite to the direction of the Earth’s field) at the dayside of the magnetosphere. 

The largest geomagnetic storms are associated with solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and high-speed solar wind stream (see ["Phenomenon : Coronal Mass Ejections"](/#/en/section/phenomena/coronal-mass-ejections) and ["Phenomenon : Coronal Holes"](/#/en/section/phenomena/coronal-holes)).  These storms also result in intense currents in the magnetosphere, changes in the radiation belts, and changes in the ionosphere, including heating the ionosphere and the upper atmosphere region (thermosphere).

**Field-aligned currents** are produced in the magnetosphere that follow the magnetic field, which connect to intense currents in the auroral ionosphere. These currents, called the **auroral electrojets**, also produce large magnetic disturbances. Together, all of these currents and the magnetic deviations they produce on the ground, are used to derive a planetary **geomagnetic disturbance index - Kp**.

Geomagnetic storms may enhance the aurora, which becomes brighter and moves closer to the equator.  Geomagnetic storms usually last a few hours to days. The strongest storms may persist for up to a week. Their frequency is higher near solar maximum, but are also common in the declining phase in the solar cycle due to high-speed solar wind stream.

Geomagnetic storms can pose problems to many activities, technological systems, and critical infrastructures (see ["Impacts"](/#/en/impacts)).
