The **molten iron core** of the Earth generates a magnetic field around our planet, called the **geomagnetic field,** which deflects charged particles from space like water around the bow of a ship. At times when the solar wind pushes particularly hard though, a significant amount of energy can be transferred over to the magnetosphere, enhancing the ring current in the equatorial region as well as its electrojets around the poles.

The interaction between magnetic field and **solar wind** would form magnetosphere. (See "phenomenon: Earth's Magnetosphere")

When coronal mass ejections (CMEs)  occurs, billion tons of plasma are ejected to the Earth. They arrive within 18hours to several days. They deposit energy and result in intense currents in the Earthâ€™s magnetosphere. The atmosphere would be heated up. Therefore the density of the atmosphere would be inceased. It could cause extra drag on satellites in **low-earth orbit**, modify the **radio signals path** or affect the performance of **GPS** systems.
