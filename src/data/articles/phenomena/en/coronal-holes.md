Coronal holes exist when the Sun’s magnetic field is open to interplanetary space. It can be developed at any time or location on the Sun. However, coronal holes locating at the solar north or south poles are the most prevalent and stable. These polar holes however can grow and expand to lower solar latitudes.  Persistent coronal holes are long-lasting sources for high speed solar winds, known as **high speed stream (HSS)**. As the HSS interacts with the relatively slower ambient solar wind, a compression region known as a **co-rotating interaction region (CIR)** forms. Strong CIRs and the faster HSS can impact the Earth’s magnetosphere enough to cause **geomagnetic storms** (see "Phenomenon : Geomagnetic Storms").
