Coronal holes are areas in the sun's **corona** (the outermost part of the Sun's atmosphere) which are **colder** and has **lower density**. It is common to see coronal holes during years of **solar minimum**. We can find them in X-ray images of the sun.

Coronal holes exist when the Sun’s magnetic field is open to interplanetary space. It can be developed at any time or location on the Sun. However, coronal holes locating at the solar north or south poles are the most prevalent and stable. They may then extent from pole to pole, or from the Sun’s equator to its pole.
