Solar radiation storms occur when large quantities of **charged particles - protons** and **electrons**, are accelerated by processes at or near the sun.

When these storms occur, the near-Earth satellite environment is bathed with high energy particles. The **polar regions** are most affected by these energetic particles because the near vertical magnetic field lines at the poles will guide the particles to spiral downwards the field lines and penetrate into the atmosphere, increasing ionization. When the influx of the charged particles is so intense that it overwhelms the magnetosphere, they can reach deeper down into the atmosphere at the poles, posing threats to astronauts in space, passengers and crews on polar flights and damage electronics on satellites and spacecrafts on the way (see ["Impacts"](/#/en/impacts)).

Solar radiation storms can last from a few hours to days, depending on the magnitude of the eruption. They can occur at any time during the solar cycle but tend to be most common around solar maximum.
