Instead of X-ray from the Sun, here we are concerned with the particle **radiation**, or more precisely, showers of protons with energy greater than 10 MeV i.e. from the soft spectrum. When the influx is so intense that it overwhelms the magnetosphere, the charged particles are able to reach deeper down into the atmosphere at the poles, posing threats to **astronauts in space, passengers and crews on polar flights and damage electronics on satellites and spacecrafts** on the way.
