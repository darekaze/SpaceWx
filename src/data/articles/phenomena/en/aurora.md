Through acceleration processes in the downwind tail of the magnetosphere and at lower altitudes along auroral field lines, **electrons** are energized. Those accelerated electrons follow the Earth's magnetic field and move down to the **polar regions**, then collide with **oxygen and nitrogen** atoms and molecules in the Earth's upper atmosphere.  In the collisions, their energy will be transferred to the atmosphere, exciting the atoms and molecules to higher energy states. When the atoms and molecules relax back down to lower energy states, energy will be released in the form of light, often known as aurora.

With the guide of the Earth's magnetic field, the aurora forms **two ovals** which are approximately centered at the **magnetic poles**. Major **geomagnetic storms** (see ["Phenomenon : Geomagnetic Storms"](#/en/section/phenomena/geomagnetic-storms)) would expand these ovals away from the poles such that aurora can sometimes be seen in lower latitude regions. Different shapes of aurora are formed by different combination of light rays. They could form arcs that stretch from horizon to horizon during the evening, which will begin to twist and sway near midnight.

At the peak (called an **auroral substorm**), these arcs may expand to fill the whole sky, moving rapidly and become very bright. In the early morning, the appearance of aurora would become more cloud-like. These diffuse patches can keep blinking repeatedly for hours before disappearing during sunrise.

## Aurora Viewing

The oval shaped regions between the north and south latitudes of about 60 and 75 degrees would be the best places to observe aurora. At these polar latitudes, the aurora can be observed more than half of the nights of a given year, of course depending on local weather, such as blocking by clouds.  In North Pole and South Pole, they are called **aurora borealis** and **aurora australis** respectively.

In general, it is more likely to see an aurora at a high latitude. However, as the Earth's magnetic poles are not exactly in line with the geographic poles, the real latitude of interest should be the **magnetic latitude**. When geomagnetic activity is low, the aurora typically is located, around midnight, at about 67 degrees magnetic latitude. As activity increases, the region of aurora expands toward the equator. When geomagnetic activity is very high, the aurora may even be seen at mid and low latitude locations around Earth.

In order to estimate the chance of seeing an aurora, one needs to know the level of geomagnetic activity at the time of viewing. A simple index called **Kp** (a number from 0 to 9) is used to refer to geomagnetic activity for a 3-hour period (see ["Phenomenon : Geomagnetic Storms"](#/en/section/phenomena/geomagnetic-storms)). Another indication of geomagnetic activity is the NOAA POES Auroral Activity Level, which is a number from 1 to 10.

To view the aurora, one would need to know the magnetic latitude of his/her location, and how high the Kp index needs to be for viewing the aurora at that magnetic latitude.

As long as a planet has an atmosphere and magnetic field, it is possible to have auroras.
