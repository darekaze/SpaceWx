# Aurora

In **North Pole** and **South Pole**, they are called **aurora borealis** and **aurora australis** respectively.

Through acceleration processes in the downwind tail of the magnetosphere and at lower altitudes along auroral field lines, **electrons** are energized. Those accelerated electrons would follow the magnetic field to move the Polar Regions. They will collide with **oxygen and nitrogen** atoms and molecules in Earth’s upper atmosphere. Then their energy will be transferred to the atmosphere. Resulting in atoms and molecules excited to higher energy states. They will release their energy in form of light when their energy states are relaxed. 

With the guide of the Earth’s magnetic field, the aurora forms 2 ovals which are approximately centered at the **magnetic poles**. **Geomagnetic storms** would expand these ovals away from the poles such that aurora can be seen over most of the United States. Different shapes of Aurora are formed by different combination of rays. They could form arcs that stretch from horizon to horizon during the evening. Arcs begin to twist and sway between evening and midnight. At the peak of auroral substorm, the arcs may expand to fill the whole sky, moving rapidly and become brighter. In the morning, the appearance of auroral would become more **cloud-like**. Diffuse patches would keep **blinking** on and off for hours and disappear due to sun rise.

The oval shaped region between the north and south latitudes of about 60 and 75 degrees would be the best place to observe aurora.

As well as a planet has an atmosphere and magnetic field, they are posible to have auroras.
