The Sun releases tremendous energy. Solar wind refers to this released energy in the form of **charged particles** (mainly protons and electrons) in a state known as a **plasma**, moving at high speed, reaching several hundred kilometres per second. The magnetic field on Earth normally protects our planet from the solar wind by trapping charged particles encircling Earth into **radiation belts** (see <a href="#/en/section/phenomena/radiation-belt">"Phenomenon : Radiation Belts"</a>).  However, it may be deformed in the event of violent solar wind, resulting in a **geomagnetic storm** (see <a href="#/en/section/phenomena/geomagnetic-storms">"Phenomenon : Geomagnetic Storms"</a>) on Earth.
