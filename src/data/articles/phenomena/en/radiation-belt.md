Radiation belt describe a region of increasing number of energetic electrons or protons surrounding the Earth. The motion and dynamics of radiation belt particles depends on the interaction between solar wind and the Earth’s magnetic and plasma environment. It is dynamic and will change on time scales of minutes to years. 

Energetic electrons or protons may emit radiation to disrupt satellites or affect the Earth’s ionosphere and upper atmosphere. When high energy radiation belt protons or galactic cosmic rays appear, the electronic state of sensitive electronic devices on satellites might be affected and therefore computer errors may be made. High energy electrons could even damage satellite cables or computer chips.
