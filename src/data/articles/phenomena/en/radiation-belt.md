Radiation belts (or Van Allen Belts) are regions of enhanced number of **energetic electrons or protons** surrounding the Earth. The motion and dynamics of radiation belt particles depend on the magnetic and electric fields in space and how these fields vary as a result of interaction between solar wind and the Earth’s magnetic and plasma environment. It is dynamic and will change on time scales of minutes to years. 

Energetic electrons or protons in the radiation belts may be hazardous to astronauts in space, and may disrupt satellites and affect the Earth’s upper atmosphere. High energy radiation belt protons or galactic cosmic rays can alter the electronic state of sensitive electronic devices on satellites, resulting in computer errors or failures, while high energy electrons can seriously damage satellite cables and computer chips. When Million Electron Volts (MeV) electrons precipitate into Earth’s upper atmosphere, they can deplete ozone and affect chemical processes in the atmosphere.
