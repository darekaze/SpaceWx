## Earth's Magnetosphere

**Differences in temperature, pressure and composition** within the inner and outer core of the earth causes convection currents in the molten metal as cool, dense matter sinks whilst warm, less dense matter rises. This flow of liquid iron generates electric currents, which in turn produce magnetic fields. Charged metals passing through these fields go on to create electric currents of their own, and so the cycle continues.

The Earth’s magnetosphere acts as a giant bubble of magnetism to protect us from the **sun’s ultraviolet radiation**. 

The magnetosphere is periodically reconfigured by **solar wind**.

After absorbing the incoming energy from the solar wind, the magnetosphere releases energy through **geomagnetic storms or substorms**. 

Apart from the earth, other planets also have their magnetosphere:
