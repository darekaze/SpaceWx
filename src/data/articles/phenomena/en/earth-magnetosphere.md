Differences in temperature, pressure and composition within the inner and outer core of the Earth cause convection currents in the molten metal (primarily iron) in its liquid outer core as cool, dense matter sinks whilst warm, less dense matter rises.  This flow of liquid iron generates electric currents, which in turn produces a **magnetic field**.  Charged metals passing through these fields go on to create electric currents of their own, and so the cycle continues.

The Earth’s magnetosphere is the region of space surrounding the Earth where the dominant magnetic field is the magnetic field of the Earth. The magnetosphere is formed by the interaction of solar wind with the Earth’s magnetic field.  It acts as a giant bubble of magnetism to protect us from the **Sun’s ultraviolet radiation** and **cosmic radiation** (see ["Phenomenon : Galactic Cosmic Rays"](/#/en/section/phenomena/galactic-cosmic-rays)).

The Earth’s magnetic field can be viewed as a dipole, with north and south poles like a simple bar magnet. Earth’s magnetic axis, the dipole, is inclined at a difference at about 11 degrees to Earth’s spin axis. 

The pressure of the solar wind on Earth’s magnetic field compresses the field on the dayside of Earth and stretches the field into a long tail on the nightside. On the dayside of Earth, the magnetic field is confined to within about 10 Earth radii from the center of Earth while on the nightside, the field is stretched out to hundreds of Earth radii.

The boundary between solar wind and the Earth’s magnetic field is called the **magnetopause**. This boundary is constantly in motion as the Earth is buffeted by the ever-changing solar wind. While the magnetopause shields us to some extent from the solar wind, energy, mass, and momentum are still transferred from the solar wind to regions inside the magnetosphere. The interaction between the solar wind and the Earth’s magnetic field, and the influence of the underlying atmosphere, create various regions of fields, plasmas, and currents inside the magnetosphere such as the **plasmasphere**, the **ring current**, and **radiation belts** (see ["Phenomenon : Radiation Belts"](/#/en/section/phenomena/radiation-belt)). The dynamic conditions inside the magnetosphere create what we call space weather that can affect technological systems and human activities.

Apart from Earth, other planets also have their magnetospheres.
