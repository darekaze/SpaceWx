Coronal mass ejection is essentially a magnetized cloud of ionised gas consisting of high speed energetic particles ejected from the Sun.

CME releases a large amount of **plasma**. It is usually associated **solar flares**. Therefore, the frequency of CME is often associated with the amount of **Sunâ€™s activity**. During solar maxima, the amount of CMEs could be three per day and at solar minima, the frequency could be once for every five days.
