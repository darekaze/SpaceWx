Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are explosive outbursts of **plasma** from the sun’s **corona**.   They contain billions of tons of coronal materials (mostly protons and electrons) and carry an embedded magnetic field.

The more explosive CMEs generally begin when highly twisted magnetic field structures contained in the sun’s lower corona become too stressed and realign into a less tense configuration – a process called magnetic reconnection. CMEs travelling faster than the background solar wind speed can generate a shock wave which can accelerate charged particles ahead of them – causing increased **solar radiation storm** (see "Phenomenon: Solar Radiation Storms") potential or intensity.

In contrast to solar flares, CMEs are not particularly bright, and may take hours to fully erupt from the sun. CMEs travel outward from the sun at speeds ranging from slower than 250 kilometers per second (km/s) to as fast as near 3000 km/s. The fastest Earth-directed CMEs can reach our planet in just 15-18 hours, while slower CMEs can take several days to arrive. CMEs expand in size as they propagate away from the Sun.

The frequency of CMEs is often associated with the amount of solar activity. During solar maxima, the amount of CMEs could be two to three per day while at solar minima, the frequency is around once per week.
