The F10.7 index refers to the **noise level generated by the sun** at a wavelength of 10.7 cm at the earth’s orbit. It is used to record and indicate solar activity. Usually the F10.7 cm Radio Emissions would be high in chromosphere(the second most outer layer of the Sun) and low in the sun’s corona. When the **number of sunspot** or **UltraViolet** and **visible solar irradiance** records increase, the F10.7 would also increase. Therefore, we can observe the climatology of solar activity and track major solar emissions through F10.7.
