Solar flares are large eruptions of **electromagnetic radiation** from the Sun. A flare appears as a sudden, intense brightening region on the sun, typically lasting from minutes to hours.

Solar flares normally erupt near sunspots where comparatively stronger magnetic field is located.  Magnetic field lines extend from the surface into the corona displaying arching shapes in broad loops. These loops trap extremely hot gas, where the temperature reaches 10 to 40 million degrees. As these magnetic fields evolve, they can reach a point of instability and release energy in a variety of forms including solar flares. These flares emit **X-ray** and **Extreme UltraViolet (EUV)** radiation which cause **radio blackouts** (see "Phenomenon : Radio Blackouts").  The electromagnetic emission produced during flares travels at the speed of light, taking about 8 minutes—rapidly affecting the dayside of Earth.
Solar flare intensities are classified in terms of peak emission in the 0.1 – 0.8 nm spectral band (soft x-rays) of the GOES satellite X-ray Sensor. The X-ray flux levels start with the “A” flares (nominally starting at 10-8 W/m2); then “B” flares; followed by “C”, “M”, and the most intense “X” flares.

|Flare Classification|Peak flux range (Watts/square metre)|
|---|---|
|A|<10^-7|
|B|<10^-7-10^-6|
|C|<10^-6-10^-5|
|M|<10^-5-10^-4|
|X|<10^(-4)-10^-3|
