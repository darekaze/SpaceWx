# 1989:  Quebec Electrical Blackout

On 10 March 1989, astronomers witnessed a powerful explosion on the Sun. Within minutes, a billion-ton cloud of gas was released from the Sun.  The storm cloud rushed towards the Earth at one million and sixty thousand kilometres per hour.   On the evening of 12 March, the vast cloud of solar plasma (a gas of electrically charged particles) finally struck Earth's magnetic field.

The extreme geomagnetic storm created a huge electrical power blackout which covered the entire province of Quebec, Canada.  The power grid failed on 13 March, leaving millions without power for more than 9 hours.   The blackout also caused closing of schools, businesses and Dorval Airport. 

In space, some satellites tumbled out of control for several hours.  NASA's TDRS-1 communication satellite recorded more than 250 anomalies as high energy particles invaded the satellite's sensitive electronics.  Even the Space Shuttle Discovery was having problems on its sensor.

*The whole province of Quebec (marked in red), Canada suffered from long duration of blackout on 13 March 1989 due to an extreme event of geomagnetic storm.   Geomagnetic latitudes are shown by blue and green curves while geographical latitudes are shown by grey horizontal lines in Mercator projection.*

*Power systems in areas of igneous rock (gray) are the most vulnerable to the effects of intense geomagnetic activity because the high resistance of the igneous rock encourages geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) to flow in the power transmission lines situated above the rock. Shown in cross-hatching are the auroral zone and the extremes that the aurora can reach during severe disturbances such as 13 March 1989 (Credits: American Geophysical Union).*

The extreme geomagnetic storm caused spectacular and very long lasting aurora in the polar regions on 13 March 1989.  The aurora could be observed in Alaska, Canada, northern Europe and even as far south as Florida and Cuba.
