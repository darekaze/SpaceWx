# Space Weather Monitoring

Space weather can be observed from the ground and space.  On the ground, telescopes and optical instruments are used to record the number of sun spots, as well as to observe aurora, which can provide evidence of geomagnetic storms.

While observation from the ground is affected by the Earth's atmosphere and weather, observation from the space does not have such limitation.  As such, satellites and spacecraft have often been used to monitor space weather.  Some of them are introduced as follows:

Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) was launched in 1995 to study solar wind and the internal structure of the Sun.  It was a cooperation between European Space Agency (ESA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) was launched in 1997 by the United States.  It is capable of measuring the composition of charged particle from the Sun and the interplanetary magnetic field.  It gives us important information on the materials released during solar events.

Transition Region and Coronal Explorer (TRACE) was launched in 1998 by the United States.  It aims at studying the evolution of magnetic field structures of the Sun.

The Geosynchronous Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) are operated by the United States. The GOES 13-15 (N-P) each carry a sophisticated X-ray telescope called the Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) to monitor the Sun’s corona.  Observations of solar X-rays aids in the early detection of solar flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and other phenomena that impact the geospace environment.

The early warning given by the SXI observations comes at least 15 hours before the associated shockwave of the solar eruption arrives at the Earth, allowing the space weather forecasters to issue timely watches, warnings and alerts.

The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft is a NASA mission which has been observing the sun since 2010. It was placed in a geosynchronous orbit (GEO) for constant communication with the ground station.

The Space Environment Monitor (SEM) on **China’s Fengyun 3C (FY-3C) satellite**, launched in September 2013, can effectively monitor the space environment and the charged particle flux, record impacts of space weather events on the satellite, and provide important data for space weather monitoring and warning.

The Meridian Project is an important technological infrastructure being developed by China in the 2010s.  It uses monitoring stations along the vicinity of the 120°E longitude and 30°N latitude and various methods such as radio, sounding rocket, etc. to build a space environment monitoring network.

Utilizing the China FengYun series satellites and the ground-based space weather monitoring network, China is able to provide monitoring data of multiple regions from the Sun to the ionosphere on a near real-time basis.  On board the six FY satellites, there are 21 instruments of eight different types of space weather monitoring facilities.  All of the monitoring work are in operation.
