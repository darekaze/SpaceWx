**Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)** release enormous amounts of energetic particles into space which present a health hazard to **astronauts**. During space missions, astronauts outside spacecraft are more exposed to space radiation.

Charged particles from the Sun may cause impacts to the equipment of the spacecraft.  For example, **high energy ions** penetrate electronic components and cause errors in **electronic signals**, leading to **improper commands** in the spaceship or **incorrect data** of an instrument.

Moreover, charge accumulation may occur in the electronics on board satellites and spacecraft, resulting in a build-up of the electric field.  When an electrical discharge eventually happens, the **electronics may be damaged**, hence affecting the operation of satellites and spacecraft.

When intense solar activities bring severe **solar winds** towards the Earth, the atmosphere in which satellites travel will increase in density.  This will increase the **drag force** on the movement of these satellites, causing a **slow down** or even **deorbit** of these satellites.
